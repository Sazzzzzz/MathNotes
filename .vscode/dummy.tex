% This is only a dummy file to trick mathjax in LaTeX Workshop
% Normally, mathjax does not support derivative package,
% thus could not provide hover preview for supported commands
% But by directing commands in derivative package like
% `\odv` to corresponding `\dv` command, we can get hover
% preview for derivative commands with physics package,
% which is supported.

% This file is NOT imported by any other file, and is not compiled
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{physics}
\newcommand{\odv}{\dv}
\newcommand{\odif}{\dd}
